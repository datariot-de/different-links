        <p>Using voice commands has become pretty ubiquitous nowadays, as <strong>more mobile phone users use voice assistants</strong> such as Siri and Cortana, and as devices such as Amazon Echo and Google Home have been invading our living rooms.</p>

        <p>These systems are built with speech recognition software that allows their users to issue voice commands. Now, our web browsers will become familiar with to Web Speech API, which allows users to integrate voice data in web apps.</p>

        <p>The world around us is full of little things and experiences that shape us, our way of thinking, but also how we tackle our work. Influenced by these encounters, <strong>every designer develops their unique style and workflow</strong>, and studying their artwork — the compositions, geometry of lines and shapes, light and shadows, the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/inspiring-illustrations-bright-colors-cool-patterns/">colors and patterns</a> — can all inspire us to look beyond our own horizon and try something new.</p>

        <p>If you're like me, then being persuaded requires a scientific approach and concrete examples. And that's exactly what this article does. It explains how gamification can work by showing the relationship between gamification, UX design and BJ Fogg's modern persuasion phenomenon, "mass interpersonal persuasion." And it has a lot of practical gamification examples that you can <strong>apply to your own products for more engaging experiences</strong>.</p>

        <p>Today, virtually all companies (except for special ones like Basecamp) have to grow non-stop. Why? Well, that's simply how the capitalist engine works. Investors pour money into startups, banks loan money to entrepreneurs, employees accept stock options instead of cash, all in the hope of the company growing much bigger.</p>

        <p>In its move to patch a security hole as part of the iOS 10.3 release, Apple has introduced (yet) another redirection mechanism that developers must handle when attempting to <strong>implement mobile deep-link routing</strong> (i.e. the mechanism to route users to a specific page inside a mobile app, rather than the App Store or app home page).</p>

        <figure><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/08/fixing-ios-security-alert"><img src="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/second-screen-examples-better-500w-opt.png" alt="The iOS 10.3 Security Alert Is Killing App Store Downloads: Here's How To Fix It" height="334" width="500"></a></figure>

        <p>This redirection instance has introduced additional friction to the app download and reopening process, and data shows that it has decreased conversion rates on iOS 10.3. This post examines the issue in detail and discusses solutions to help developers fix it.</p>

        <p>Component-based libraries or frameworks such as Vue have given us the wonderful ability to create <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/02/writing-next-generation-reusable-javascript-modules/">reusable components</a> to be spread throughout their respective application, ensuring that they are consistent, and (hopefully) simplifying how they are used.</p>

        <p>In particular, form inputs tend to have plenty of complexity that you'd want to hide in a component, such as custom designs, labels, validation, help messages, and making sure each of these pieces are in the correct order so that they render correctly.</p>

        <p>Do you ever wish you had a time machine? I certainly do, but not for the usual reasons. I want a time machine so I can go back and have a frank conversation with my younger self. I’ll let you in on a bit of a secret: <strong>My younger self was an idiot!</strong></p>

        <p>In these politically uncertain times, developers can help to <strong>defend their users’ personal privacy</strong> by adopting the <em>Privacy by Design (PbD)</em> framework. These common-sense steps will become a requirement under the EU's imminent data protection overhaul, but the benefits of the framework go far beyond legal compliance.</p>

        <figure><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/07/privacy-by-design-framework/"><img src="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/privacy-by-design-800.png" alt="If you are collecting personal data, you have to abide by the rules" height="444" width="500"></a></figure>

        <p>Let’s give credit where credit is due. The global political upheaval of the past 12 months has done more to get developers thinking about privacy, surveillance and <strong>defensive user protection</strong> than ever before. The risks and threats to ourselves, and to our users, are no longer theoretical; they are real, they are everyday, and they are frightening.</p>

        <p>Earlier this year, support for <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/11/css-grids-flexbox-and-box-alignment-our-new-system-for-web-layout/">CSS grid layout</a> landed in most major desktop browsers. Naturally, the specification is one of the hot topics at meet-ups and conferences. After having some conversations about grid and progressive enhancement, I believe that there’s a <strong>good amount of uncertainty</strong> about using it. I heard some quite interesting questions and statements, which I want to address in this post.</p>

        <p>“When can I start using CSS grid layout?” “Too bad that it’ll take some more years before we can use grid in production.” “Do I need Modernizr in order to make websites with CSS grid layout?” “If I wanted to use grid today, I’d have to build two to three versions of my website.” The CSS grid layout module is one of the most exciting developments since responsive design. We should try to get the best out of it as soon as possible, if it makes sense for us and our projects.</p>

        <p>New APIs offer great possibilities to <strong>build better web services</strong>. And some people push these new technologies to their limits. For example, we can use JavaScript to generate images that we then can use in Web Notifications. We can use the Storage API to find out if and how much data we can save on a user’s device and can adjust the behavior of our applications accordingly.</p>

        <p>When we think about a slider, we usually imagine an image gallery slider, or the infamous carousel, or perhaps off-canvas navigation, with the overlay sliding in from the side. However, this article is not about those kinds of sliders. Instead, we’ll look into the fine details of <strong>designing better slider controls</strong> for selecting a value or a range of values. Think of price range sliders, 360-degree-view sliders, timeline sliders, health insurance quote calculators, or build-your-own-mobile-plan features.</p>

        <p>In all of these use cases, a slider is helpful because it allows users to explore a wide range of options quickly. For precise input, a slider can never beat a regular input field, but we can use a slider to <strong>nudge our customers</strong> to explore available options and, hence, aid them in making an informed decision.</p>

But first, we need to figure out when a slider makes sense in the first place. (Please note: that article is <strong>quite large</strong>, and contains many animations and videos.)</p>
